## Pretty-printer algorithm

The pretty-printer is based on Philip Karlton’s Mesa pretty-printer, as described in the appendix to Derek C. Oppen, “Pretty Printing” (1979), Stanford Computer Science Department STAN-CS-79-770, http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/79/770/CS-TR-79-770.pdf.
This algorithm's implementation is taken from `prettyplease` which is adapted from `rustc_ast_pretty`.

The algorithm takes from an input stream of length `n` and an output device with margin width `m`, the algorithm requires time `O(n)` and space `O(m)`.
The algorithm is described in terms of two parallel processes; the first scans the input stream to determine the space required to print logical blocks of tokens; the second uses this information to decide where to break lines of text; the two processes
communicate by means of a buffer of size `o(m)`. The algorithm does not wait for the entire stream to be input, but begins printing as soon as it has received a linefull of input.
