A formatter for the leptos view! macro

All notable changes are documented in: [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Install

`cargo install leptosfmt`

or for trying out unreleased features:

`cargo install --git https://github.com/bram209/leptosfmt.git`

## Usage

```
Usage: leptosfmt [OPTIONS] [INPUT_PATTERNS]...

Arguments:
  [INPUT_PATTERNS]...  A space separated list of file, directory or glob

Options:
  -m, --max-width <MAX_WIDTH>      Maximum width of each line
  -t, --tab-spaces <TAB_SPACES>    Number of spaces per tab
  -c, --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>  Configuration file
  -s, --stdin                      Format stdin and write to stdout
  -r, --rustfmt                    Format with rustfmt after formatting with leptosfmt (requires stdin)
      --override-macro-names 
        <OVERRIDE_MACRO_NAMES>...  Override formatted macro names
  -q, --quiet                      
      --check                      Check if the file is correctly formatted. Exit with code 1 if not
  -h, --help                       Print help
  -V, --version                    Print version
```

## Using with Rust Analyzer

You can set the `rust-analyzer.rustfmt.overrideCommand` setting.


```json
  "rust-analyzer.rustfmt.overrideCommand": ["leptosfmt", "--stdin", "--rustfmt"]
```

And **you must** configure `rustfmt` to use the correct edition, place a `rustfmt.toml` file in the root of your project:
```toml
edition = "2021"
# (optional) other config...
```

> Note: For VSCode users, I recommend to use workpsace settings (CMD + shift + p -> Open workspace settings), so that you can only configure `leptosfmt` for workpsaces that are using leptos. For Neovim users, I recommend using [neoconf.nvim](https://github.com/folke/neoconf.nvim) for managing project-local LSP configuration.

## Configuration
You can configure all settings through a `leptosfmt.toml` file.

```toml
max_width = 100 # Maximum width of each line
tab_spaces = 4 # Number of spaces per tab
indentation_style = "Auto" # "Tabs", "Spaces" or "Auto"
newline_style = "Auto" # "Unix", "Windows" or "Auto"
attr_value_brace_style = "WhenRequired" # "Always", "AlwaysUnlessLit", "WhenRequired" or "Preserve"
macro_names = [ "leptos::view", "view" ] # Macro names which will be formatted
```

To see what each setting does, the see [configuration docs](./docs/configuration.md)

## Examples

**Single file**

Format a specific file by name

`leptosfmt ./examples/counter/src/lib.rs`

**Current directory**

Format all .rs files within the current directory

`leptosfmt .`

**Directory**

Format all .rs files within the examples directory

`leptosfmt ./examples`

**Glob**

Format all .rs files ending with `_test.rs` within the examples directory

`leptosfmt ./examples/**/*_test.rs`

## A note on non-doc comments

Currently this formatter does not support non-doc comments in code blocks. It uses a fork of prettyplease for formatting rust code, and `prettyplease` does not support this. I would like to not diverge this fork too much (so I can easily keep in sync with upstream), therefore I didn't add non-doc comment support in my prettyplease fork for now.
This means that you _can_ use non-doc comments throughout your view macro, as long as they don't reside within code blocks.

> A bit more context: `prettyplease` uses `syn` to parse rust syntax. According to https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/comments.html#non-doc-comments non-doc comments _are interpreted as a form of whitespace_ by the parser; `syn` basically ignores/skips these comments and does not include them in the syntax tree.

## Pretty-printer algorithm

The pretty-printer is based on Philip Karlton’s Mesa pretty-printer, as described in the appendix to Derek C. Oppen, “Pretty Printing” (1979), Stanford Computer Science Department STAN-CS-79-770, http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/79/770/CS-TR-79-770.pdf.
This algorithm's implementation is taken from `prettyplease` which is adapted from `rustc_ast_pretty`.

The algorithm takes from an input stream of length `n` and an output device with margin width `m`, the algorithm requires time `O(n)` and space `O(m)`.
The algorithm is described in terms of two parallel processes; the first scans the input stream to determine the space required to print logical blocks of tokens; the second uses this information to decide where to break lines of text; the two processes
communicate by means of a buffer of size `o(m)`. The algorithm does not wait for the entire stream to be input, but begins printing as soon as it has received a linefull of input.
